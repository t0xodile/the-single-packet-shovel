|Resource|Description|
|-|-|
|sp&#x2011;tunnel.py|A [Turbo Intruder](https://github.com/PortSwigger/turbo-intruder) script to aid in exploitation. It will repeat the single-packet attack until it recieves a tunnelled response| 
|single&#x2011;packet&#x2011;tunneller/|Burp extension used during the research. Also supports guessing internal headers using [param-miner](https://github.com/PortSwigger/param-miner) logic + single-packet attack. To build, I recommend opening the project in [intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) and building it there|
